This project focuses on employing machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest and Naive Bayes algorithms, for the early detection and diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

Key Features

Random Forest and Naive Bayes Models: Implements Random Forest and Naive Bayes algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of PCOS presence or severity.
Data Collection and Processing: Provides tools and guidelines for collecting relevant patient data including hormonal profiles, and clinical symptoms. Offers preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for model training.
